If using inkscape to view the .svg files you probably won't see anything
because the lines are too fine.  Select them and change the stroke width to
0.03mm or 0.3mm and they'll show up much better.  Just remember to change them
back to 0.003mm before you send the files to Ponoko.

radish.skp is a Google SketchUp file that pretty accurately represents a 3D
model of the Radish.
